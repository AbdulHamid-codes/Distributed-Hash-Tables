# Distributed-Hash-Tables
This was the semster project for the course "CS-218 Data Structures" of my BS-Computer science where, i along with a group mate 
implemented a distrubuted hash table to simulate a distributed system of machines. The hash hash function SHA-1 was used to hash values and the
code is entirely in C++. A dynamic circular chord of machines is made to store and manipulate data in O(log N). 
The project is done in Visual Studio 19.

Run the code in VS and the rest is self explanatory!
