# Distributed-Hash-Tables
This was the semster project for the course "CS-218 Data Structures" of my BS-Computer science where, i along with a group mate 
implemented a distrubuted hash table to simulate a distributed system of machines. The hash hash function SHA-1 was used and the
code is entirely in C++. A dynamic circular chord of machines is made to store and manipulate data in O(log N). 
This project is done in Visual Studio 20.
